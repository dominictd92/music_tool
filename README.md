# music_tool
A tool to help update and organize mp3 files. Created this for fun and because I had a large number of mp3 files with incorrect metadata that I wanted to update. 

## Updates to come

* Remove use of TinyTag
* Account for Comments, artwork, and other tags that aren't covered by EasyMP3
* Complete the functionality for Artist and Album update
* Update all tags with "sort" at the end with the proper information
* Use an API to pull the song information from the internet and auto-fill where possible
